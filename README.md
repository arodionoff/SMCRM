This repo currently contains:

* the data sets used in the text as *Microsoft Excel Files* and *Data Frames* in **R** package [SMCRM](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/SMCRM "created by Tobias Verbeke").

* the **R** code that reproduces the analyses in the book. 

Each analysis has a list of required R packages and enumerates the package versions that were used for the analyses contained in the text. Most analyses use visualizations and tables that are consistent with the [on-line version](https://rpubs.com/A_Rodionoff/SMCRM "Russian Version") and are interactive where possible.

There is no code for chapters 1-2 and 8-9.

The Implementation of the **SAS** code in the **R** programming language by **[Alexander Rodionov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandr-rodionov-b8239769)** in 2018.
